# Raspberry Pi Positioning Tracker

This project tracks the position of a Raspberry PI in terms of latitude, longitude, x/y/z axis, and whether or not it has  been moved or dropped.

### Raspberry PI Setup

The Raspberry PI is connected to an Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout board and an ADXL345 Digital Accelerometer board through a breadboard and data from these boards are collected from a Python script on the PI.

### How it works

The Raspberry Pi communicates to the AWS through the AWS IOT service which is updated with the position of the device.  Everytime the AWS IOT shadow of the Raspberry PI is updated, an AWS Lambda function runs and saves the position to an Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL database as well as to AWS S3 as a JSON file.  In addition, an AWS API Gateway is also created so that the React application can constantly grab the current data of the Raspberry PI.  Every time the API URL is called, an AWS Lambda function is called to grab the data from S3. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
